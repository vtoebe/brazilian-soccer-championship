This project was made during Santander + Let's Code scholarship, as a test.

Its purpose is: 
- receive a ".csv" file containing data from a fictional soccer championship,
- read the file, treat all data according to which teams played each game,
- calculate the final score for all teams,
- return a ".txt" file for each team, containing its games,
- return a ".csv" file containing the final ranking.

As an extra, after the task is completed, a modal window opens the files with a simple GUI.

This project was 100% developed in Java.
